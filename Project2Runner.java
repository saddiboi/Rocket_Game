     ******** Project Description ********
     * 
     *This is simple "Rocket" game that is represented by shapes. Users will move the Rocket
     *around the screen with "WASD" keys (W for up, A for left, S for down, D for right). Users
     *need to avoid the round colorful planets and go to the green box to win. 
     *A button called " Difficult!!!" is also implemented that will make the game more difficult 
     *by making the planets invisible so that the users need to remember where the planets were before they dispeared.
     *It also has a reset button that resets the entire window and the position of the planets are changed.
