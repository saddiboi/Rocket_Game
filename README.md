Hello! As this is one of my first projects, I decided to create a simple rocket game. You can use you WASD key to move around but be careful, if you hit one of the planet, you will be sent back to your starting point!

Travel to the green box to WIN!

<p>Here is a preview of the game:</p>

<p>You can also chnage the difficulty of the game by making the planets invisible:</p>

<p>And you can reset the game so that the planets are in different positions, making it challenging:</p>
